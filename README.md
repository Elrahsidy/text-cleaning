This repository includes one python notebook where I explore string matching as means for data cleaning using Levenshtein distance and Cosine vector similarity. I also explore whether both techniques I implement could be further exploited to generate features that are suitable for unsupervised machine learning. I am yet to start working on the machine-learning part of this project since I need some time to think about which algorithm to choose. As it stands, this project should be helpful to anyone that cleans text data regularly or someone working with preparing data for NLP.
